[Intro]

Oh God you are my God 

And I will seek the earnestly

Oh God youare my God 

And I will seek thee earnestly

My soul thirst for thee

My soul thirst for thee

In a dry and weary land 

Where there's no water

Thus, I have behold thee

In the sanctuay

To see thy Power and thy Glory



So I will bless thee

As long as I live

And I Will lift my hands

In thy name 

So I will bless thee

As long as I live 

And in the shadow of thy wings

I sing for joy.
