[Intro]
You did not waitfor me

To drawnear to You

But you clothed yourself

With frail humanity


You did not wait for me

To cry out to you

But you let me hear your voice calling me.


And I'm forever grateful to you

I'm forever grateful for the cross

I'm forever grateful to you,Jesus

that you came to seek 

And save the lost.
\n
[Repeat 2x]
