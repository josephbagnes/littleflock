[Intro]
God will make a way
Where there seems to be no way
He works in ways we cannot see
He will make a way for me
He will be my guide
Hold me closely to His side
With love and strength for each new day
He will make a way, He will make a way
\n
By a roadway in the wilderness, He'll lead me
Rivers in the desert will I see
Heaven and earth will fade but His Word will still remain
And He will do something new today
\n
\n
Gagawa ang Diyos ng daan sa buhay ko
Pagkilos niya'y mahiwaga
Sa'kin may layunin Siya
S'yang aking gabay
Ang kasama't karamay
Pag-ibig niya'y kalakasan
S'ya'y aking gabay
`}/>
