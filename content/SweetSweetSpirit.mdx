[Intro]

There's a sweet, sweet spirit in this place

And I know that it's spirit of the Lord

There are sweet expessions on each face

And I know they feel the pressence of the

Lord


[Chorus]
	
Sweet Holy Spirit, sweet heavenly dove

Stay right there here with us

Filling us your love

And for these blessings,

We lift ou hearts in praise 

Without a doubt we'll know 

That we have been revived

When we shall leave this place.



There are blessings you cannot receive

'Till you know him in his fullness and
believe


You're the one to profit when you say

I am going to walk with Jesus all the way.
