[Intro]
G   D  
\n
[Verse 1]
G         D                 
My Jesus, My Savior
Em                       C
Lord, there is none like you
G               C         G
All of my days, I want to praise
    C          F           D
The wonders of Your mighty love
\n
[Verse 2]
G           D                 
My comfort, my shelter
Em                  C
Tower of refuge and strength
          G      C          G
Let every breath all that I am
C              F       D
Never cease to worship you
\n
[Chorus]
G            Em           C            D
Shout to the Lord all the Earth let us sing
C         Em      C             D
Power and majesty praise to the king
G             Em                                C
Mountains bow down and the seas will roar
        D    C       D   D7
At the sound of your name
G          Em         C             D
I sing for joy at the works of your hands
C         Em       C         D
Forever I love you forever I stand
G       Em              C         D       G
Nothing compares to the promise I have in You
\n
