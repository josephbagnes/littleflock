[Intro]
Em-G-Em-G
(repeat)
\n
[Verse 1]
\n
            Em
All these pieces 
           G
Broken and scattered
         Em
In mercy gathered
          G
Mended and whole
      Em
Empty handed
           G
But not forsaken
             D
I've been set free
            Em     D
I've been set free
\n
[Verse 2]
\n
             Em 
You take our failure
             G
You take our weakness
             Em
You set Your treasure
          G
In jars of clay
             Em            
So take this heart, Lord
             G
I'll be Your vessel
            D
The world to see
           Em   D
Your life in me
\n
[Prechorus]
\n
 C
Amazing grace
    D
How sweet the sound
     Em                    C 
That saved a wretch like me
  C            
I once was lost
    D
But now I am found
    Em                 C
Was blind but now I see
\n
[Chorus]
\n
                 G    D
Oh I can see You now
                 Em             C
Oh I can see the love in Your eyes
                G   D
Laying Yourself down
               Em         C
Raising up the broken to life
