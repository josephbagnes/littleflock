[Verse 1]
G
When you lift your hands up high

And you sing a song of praise to me,

It brings me great delight

Such a lovely sight, and yes it is true
C	D				 G
Praise looks good on you.

Morning, night and noon

Your praise ascends to heaven

Like the smell of sweet perfume

Filling every room, and yes it is true
C	D				 G
Praise looks good on you.

[Chorus 1]
Em						A
You bring your sacrifices
Em					  A
And you offer up your praise
Bm
You lift your voice with singing
		 F#m					
But your hearts seems far away

More than a sacrifice
Em					  A
I am looking for your life

Holy and acceptable

And pleasing in my sight.

Remember all He wants is you
    C		  Am - D
And yes it is true
C	D				 G
Praise looks good on you
