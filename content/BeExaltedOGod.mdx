[Intro]
  
  I will give thanks to these O Lord among
  the people

  I will sing praises to thee among the nations

  For the steadfast love is great

  Is great to the heavens

  And thy faithfulness, thy faithfulness to
  the clouds


  Be exalted O God above the heavens 
   
  Let the glory be over all the earth

  Be exalted O God above the heavens

  Let thy glory, let thy glory

  Be over all the earth.
